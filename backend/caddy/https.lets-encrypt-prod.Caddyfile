#
# 🚨 Warning: If your DNS and Caddy configuration aren't properly configured (as 
#             specified in https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https), you can 
#             run into Let's Encrypt rate limits which can block your certificates 
#             for up to a week. 
#             It's strongly recommened that you use the staging Caddyfile 
#             (https.lets-encrypt-staging.Caddyfile) to test your
#             configuration before switching to this production one.
