Once you have selected an issue, clone the project locally and create a branch for your work. You'll be creating a markdown file in the `/posts` directory. You can follow our [Getting started](https://github.com/sourcegraph/learn#getting-started) guidance if you would like to run a local development environment to preview your work, which is recommended.

## Step 3 — Create your tutorial

Follow the example tutorial [How to troubleshoot Python ZeroDivisionError](https://learn.sourcegraph.com/how-to-troubleshoot-python-zerodivisionerror) and the guidance in the issue on how to structure your tutorial. Test the code and ensure everything is grammatically correct.

## Step 4 — (optional) Add your name and details to the authors.yaml file

If you would like to add your name to the `authors.yaml` file, follow the format in `/data/authors.yaml`. 

## Step 5 — Open a pull request
