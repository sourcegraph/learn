If you are working with curl and receiving no data that could mean curl is not following redirects.

## Reproducing the error

```
curl sourcegraph.com
```

## Follow redirects

There is a chance that site you try to access redirects you to another site.

To make curl follow redirects you need to use `--location` flag or `-L` for short.

```
curl -L sourcegraph.com
```

## Fail on error

If server returns error â€“ response code grater than 399 then curl by default will not set exit code to indicate error occurred,
so if no other data will be sent by a server then you will get nothing.
To prevent that you may want to add `--fail` (`-f`) flag to show error and set exit code to 22 if something is wrong.

```
curl --fail  -L -X POST sourcegraph.com
curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 403
```

## Be verbose

If non of the above helped, turn verbose mode with `-v` flag. It will make could more talkative.

```
curl sourcegraph.com -v
