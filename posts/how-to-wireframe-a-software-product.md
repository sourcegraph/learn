A wireframe is like a blueprint or skeleton of your software project. It helps the designer organize the information architecture of a website, app, or product. Wireframing usually comes later in the design process, after gathering user research and just before creating final prototypes, so that you can begin sketching the interface based on how a user would interact with it. Wireframing can be done with pen and paper or with software.

This short guide will include some pointers and guidelines on the most effective ways to draw wireframes that support designers, developers, and product managers in creating impactful software products. It helps everyone align their objectives for what content, functionality, and user interactions they expect from their product, while giving visual designers, stakeholders, business analysts, and others involved in product development an overview of it.  

## Prerequisites

 * Make sure you’ve completed your user research before beginning. User research should give you a clear understanding of who your target users are, as well as their needs and expectations. Some UX research methods include user personas, user flow maps, and use cases. You will want to have completed competitor research and analysis of similar products as well.
 * You will need to have business requirements and design briefs in hand.
 * You’ll want to have conducted stakeholder interviews.
 * If you have an existing website or app in place, you should review relevant analytics so that that can inform the strategy moving forward. 
 * For products that contain content, you will want to have an understanding of your future content strategy.
 * Tools to wireframe your project: all you need is pen and paper, but you may also consider using other digital sketching tools mentioned below.

## Step 1 — List requirements

First, you will need to create a list of requirements and specifications for your software project. This includes any features you want to include, or layout ideas you’ve come across in competitor research. List each screen the user will interact with and the relevant content to include on each screen. 

## Step 2 — Plan the user flow

If you haven’t done so already, have a clear sense of the order of the screens your target user will see, from their first interaction with your product to where they end up. This is called a user flow. It ensures that interacting with your product is intuitive and doesn’t leave the user confused or frustrated. It also helps you simplify what you need to sketch and in what order. 


Usually it’s recommended to start with mobile screens, because working with a smaller screen first helps you stay consistent across devices, and also privileges responsive design.

## Step 3 — Choose a sketch tool

Now we are almost ready to start sketching. At this point, you can grab a marker or pen to draw an outline of features and other layout elements of each screen. However, depending on how your team collaborates and whether they are together or distributed, you may want to consider alternate tools.

There are a number of wireframing tools in addition to sketching on paper that you can use.

 * A physical whiteboard or a whiteboard app like [miro](https://miro.com)
 * Apps like the [Paper app](https://wetransfer.com/paper)
 * A digital tool like [MURAL](https://www.mural.co)
 * A collaborative interface design tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)  

It is important to use a tool that will work for your team and their shared purpose. If there is a steep learning curve to get your team onboarded, you may try a low-tech tool. If your team is remote and distributed globally, you may opt for a tool that allows collaboration and commenting.

## Step 4 — Brainstorm to prompt sketching

At first, you’ll want to stay general and add in details later, because you may need to play around with the basics until you get specific about visual design. Let yourself brainstorm on the page. The point is to get a quick, sketchy overview down. 

Some questions to ask yourself as you sketch: 

 * When the user is on this screen, what will they look for? What are their goals at each screen? 
 * What features or buttons or text need to be most prominently displayed?
 * Imagine you’re a user new to this app or website. What would you be thinking as you look at this screen? Does it feel easy to figure out? Is anything unclear or missing? 

With these initial thoughts in place, we can move onto filling in some fundamental details. 

## Step 5 — Wireframe the basics

Start with the basics and keep it simple:
 * Draw boxes to block out sections of content on your screen and bars for where the user’s own input will go
 * Boxes drawn with `X`s typically represent images. 
 * Use squiggles or lines to mark where text will go.
 * Optionally, depending on what you know about the content, include high-fidelity text and color to create a more accurate or realistic depiction of the screen.
 * Decide on your placement of basic features like navigation menus and search bars. Putting these elements in familiar places (following usability conventions) can make it easier for users to navigate your app, website, or product. 
 * Don’t include visual elements at this stage, leave that for later or for the graphic designer(s).
 * If you’re struggling to pin down a good screen layout or flow, there are UX pattern libraries you can search through for inspiration, like [ReallyGoodUX](https://www.reallygoodux.io/), [UXArchive](https://uxarchive.com/), and [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/studiopatterns). 

## Step 6 — Annotate your wireframe

Write in instructional copy and calls-to-action. If needed, consider adding tooltips for users as they use their cursor to hover over features on the screen. 

Creating an annotated wireframe can be useful when you need to include notes on interactions like swipes, clicks, pop-ups, and when you need to include specific details about the content, like graphics and links, and constraints related to the browser and data.

## Step 7 — Wireframe the user flow

When you have your sketches of individual screens, it’s time to find a way to represent user flows. This can be as straightforward as drawing the screens side by side in order of the user’s journey using the software project, and using arrows to indicate pathways from interaction to change in screen along with any notes about what each screen is for. For example, you can map out signing up for a newsletter, which then takes the user to a form.

## Next Steps

Generally, the process to move from your wireframe to coding your software project is: wireframe, low fidelity prototype, high fidelity mockup, visual design, and finally code. Now that you have a complete wireframe of your project, you are ready to create a lo-fi prototype that you can test before you create a hi-fi mockup. There are tools like [Prott](https://prottapp.com/) that design and developer teams can use to make wireframe sketches interactive and quickly create screens based on your sketches. 

Once you have a prototype, you can conduct user tests with colleagues and friends, and then update your sketches to reflect any improvements or new ideas. When you’re ready to develop more interactive or high fidelity prototypes, there are many digital tools, but the most commonly used and comprehensive ones are Sketch, InVision, Balsamiq, Axure, and Adobe XD.
