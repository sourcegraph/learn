# How to create a Sourcegraph cloud account

Sourcegraph cloud lets you search across open source software and your private repositories hosted on GitHub or GitLab in a web browser. To begin using Sourcegraph cloud, you can navigate directly to [sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com) and begin searching the code that Sourcegraph has already indexed. If you would like to save your search history or to connect your public or private repositories on GitHub or GitLab, you will need to create a Sourcegraph cloud account.

**_Note that searching private code on Sourcegraph cloud is currently in Public Beta._**

There are three ways to sign up for a Sourcegraph cloud account, which will be detailed in the sections below. Feel free to skip ahead to your preferred method of signing up:

* [Creating a Sourcegraph cloud account with GitHub](#creating-a-sourcegraph-cloud-account-with-github)
* [Creating a Sourcegraph cloud account with GitLab](#creating-a-sourcegraph-cloud-account-with-gitlab)
* [Creating a Sourcegraph cloud account with an email address](#creating-a-sourcegraph-cloud-account-with-an-email-address)

Open your browser of choice, and we can get started.

## Navigate to the Sourcegraph cloud sign up page

In your browser address bar, type in [sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com). When the page is fully loaded, you’ll receive a page similar to the following, with Sourcegraph’s logo and a search bar.

On the right-hand side of the top navigation pane, there is a **Sign up** button that takes you to the [account creation](https://sourcegraph.com/sign-up) page. The **Sign up** page is where you can create an account.

From here, you can continue to signing up through your option of choice.

## Creating a Sourcegraph cloud account with GitHub

To use GitHub authentication, from the [Sign up](https://sourcegraph.com/sign-up) page, click on the **Continue with GitHub** button. Clicking on the GitHub button will take you to GitHub’s login page if you are not already logged in.

Once you are logged into GitHub, you will be directed to a page that requires you to authorize Sourcegraph. The authorization you will be giving to Sourcegraph will allow Sourcegraph to access the GitHub details mentioned in the signup form for your account creation.

If you choose to authorize Sourcegraph, you will be redirected to Sourcegraph cloud’s welcome page. By completing these steps, you have successfully created a Sourcegraph cloud account using GitHub.

## Creating a Sourcegraph cloud account with GitLab

If you have a GitLab account and would prefer to create a Sourcegraph account that is tied to your GitLab account, click on the **GitLab** button on Sourcegraph cloud’s **[Sign up](https://sourcegraph.com/sign-up)** page.

If you are not signed into your GitLab account, you will be redirected to log into GitLab to continue.

![Login to GitLab](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/learn/tutorial-images/gitlab-login.png)

If you are logged into GitLab, you will need to login so that you can authorize GitLab as the method to create a Sourcegraph cloud account.

![Authroize Sourcegraph cloud with GitLab](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/learn/tutorial-images/authorize-sourcegraph-on-gitlab.png)

Clicking on **Authorize** will allow Sourcegraph to have access to the GitLab details that are mentioned in the signup form for your account creation.

If you choose to authorize Sourcegraph, you will be redirected to Sourcegraph cloud’s welcome page. By completing these steps, you have successfully created a Sourcegraph cloud account using GitLab.

## Creating a Sourcegraph cloud account with an email address

To create a Sourcegraph account by providing an email address, you will need to use a valid address that you can access. 

On the **Sign up** page, there is a [continue with email](https://sourcegraph.com/sign-up?showEmail=true) link below the code host buttons. Clicking on this link takes you to a form where you can create an account using an email address. Enter the valid email address you would like to use in the form input space labeled **Email**.

![Sourcegraph cloud signup with email form](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/learn/tutorial-images/sourcegraph-cloud-signup-email-field.png)

An invalid email address will throw an error message and will not let you complete the account creation process.

Each Sourcegraph username that is tied to an email address will need to be unique, as there are no two users with the same username on Sourcegraph cloud.

Enter your preferred username in the form input section labeled **Username**.

![Sourcegraph cloud valid username field with email signup](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/learn/tutorial-images/username-field-sourcegraph-signup-form.png)

If the username you have chosen is in use by another user, there will be an error that indicates that the username is taken. In this case, you can modify your preferred username to continue.

Next, create a password. A password lets you add a layer of security to your account by preventing unauthorized access.

When creating a Sourcegraph account, your chosen password should be at least 12 characters. Enter a secure password in the form input section labeled **Password**.

After completing the three steps above completely, you can click on the **Register** button to create an account. At this point, you will be taken to the welcome page of your account.

## Security on Sourcegraph cloud

Your security and privacy are very important to Sourcegraph; Sourcegraph will have no access to see your private code and will never sell your private code. Only you and your teammates with access to a given private repository via your code host will be able to see the private code you have added to Sourcegraph.
